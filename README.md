# push_swap

Welcome to my Push_swap project repository! This project, part of the 42 curriculum, focuses on sorting data on a stack using a limited set of instructions while aiming to use the fewest possible actions. It involves manipulating various algorithms and selecting the most appropriate solution for optimized data sorting.
